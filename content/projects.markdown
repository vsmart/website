# Projects

I like working on open-source projects. You can find most of my code on [Github](https://github.com/vsmart).

Some projects I've contributed to recently:

* _Delete Your Tweets._ An app that lets you delete your old tweets. It is built with Phoenix & Elixir and running on Heroku. You can try it [here](https://delete-your-tweets.franka.tech).

## Games

I also like making tiny games. You can play some of them online:

* _Sleepy dog._ A game made for the BerlinMiniJam in January 2017. It's written in Clojurescript with Quil. The theme was _Cats, Dogs and Nighttime_, so I made a game about a sleepy, hungry dog. You can play it [here](https://franka.tech/games/sleepy-dog).

* _The mermaid situation._ A point-and-click that a friend and I made for LudumDare 2016 with ClojureScript and Quil. You're a mermaid stuck in a room who wants to get back to the sea. Try it [here](https://lislis.de/games/mermaid-situation)
