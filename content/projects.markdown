# Projects

I like working on open-source projects. You can find most of my code on [Github](https://github.com/vsmart).

Some projects I've done recently:

* _Delete Your Tweets._ An app that lets you delete your old tweets. It is built with Phoenix & Elixir and running on Heroku. You can try it [here](https://delete-your-tweets.franka.tech).
