## Work & Community

From 2015 - 2019, I was one of the organisers of the [ClojureBridge](http://clojurebridge-berlin.org) chapter in Berlin. ClojureBridge organises free coding workshops for women and non-binary people.

Previously (2017 - 2020) I was a platform & security engineer at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com).

Before that, I was a Backend Engineer at [Wunderlist](https://wunderlist.com) - later acquired by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), working on the backend and infrastructure to power to-do lists syncing across devices.
