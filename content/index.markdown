# Hi, I'm Franka &#128075;

I live in Berlin and like typing code. I'm a backend developer and interested in building things with kind people.

I organise [ClojureBridge](https://clojurebridge-berlin.org) workshops in Berlin, where we give free coding workshops to women and non-binary people.

You can contact me at mail\[at\]franka.tech. If you like, you can use my [pgp key](key) to contact me.

## Projects

I like working on open-source projects. You can find most of my code on [Github](https://github.com/vsmart).

Some projects I've done recently:

* [Delete Your Tweets](https://delete-your-tweets.franka.tech)
  An app that lets you delete your old tweets. Written in Phoenix & Elixir.


## Talks

Recently I've given the following talks:

* [Adventures in Homoiconicity](/talks/homoiconicity-talk) at [:clojureD Berlin](https://clojured.de)

* [Shipping an Elixir app: from first commit to live](/talks/ship-it-talk) at [Women Who Code Berlin](link)

* Mutation testing in Clojure with Mutant at the Clojure Meetup Berlin

## Games

I like making tiny games. You can play some of them online:

* Sleepy dog: play it [here](/games/sleepy-dog)

* The mermaid situation: try it [here](https://lislis.de/games/mermaid-situation)
