# Hi, I'm Franka &#128075;

I live in Berlin and like typing code. I'm a backend developer and interested in building things with kind people.

I am one of the organisers of the [ClojureBridge](http://clojurebridge-berlin.org) chapter in Berlin. We give free coding workshops for women and non-binary people.

You can contact me at mail\[at\]franka.tech. If you like, you can use my [pgp key](key) to contact me.

## Projects

I like working on open-source projects. You can find most of my code on [Github](https://github.com/vsmart).

Some projects I've done recently:

* _Delete Your Tweets._ An app that lets you delete your old tweets. It is built with Phoenix & Elixir and running on Heroku. You can try it [here](https://delete-your-tweets.franka.tech).

## Talks

Recently I've given the following talks:

* _Adventures in Homoiconicity_  at [:clojureD Berlin](http://www.clojured.de/schedule/#details-9) in February 2017 - [Slides](https://franka.tech/talks/homoiconicity-talk)

* _Shipping an Elixir app: from first commit to live_ at [Women Who Code Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Berlin-Germany/events/236692747/) in January 2017 - [Slides](https://franka.tech/talks/ship-it)

* _Mutation testing in Clojure with Mutant_ at the Clojure Meetup Berlin in December 2016

## Games

I like making tiny games. You can play some of them online:

* _Sleepy dog._ A game made for the BerlinMiniJam in January 2017. It's written in Clojurescript with Quil. The theme was _Cats, Dogs and Nighttime_, so I made a game about a sleepy, hungry dog. You can play it [here](https://franka.tech/games/sleepy-dog).

* _The mermaid situation._ try it [here](https://lislis.de/games/mermaid-situation)
