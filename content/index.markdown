# Hi, I'm Franka &#128075;

I live in Berlin and like typing code. I'm a platform engineer at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) and I'm interested in building things with kind people.

I am one of the organisers of the [ClojureBridge](http://clojurebridge-berlin.org) chapter in Berlin. We give free coding workshops for women and non-binary people.

You can contact me via [email](mailto:hello@franka.tech) and find my code on [Github](https://github.com/vsmart). If you like, you can use my [pgp key](https://franka.tech/Franka_pub.asc) to contact me.
