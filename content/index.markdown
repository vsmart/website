# Hi, I'm Franka &#128075;

I'm a software engineer, dog person and coffee drinker based in Berlin.

From 2017 - 2020 I was a platform & security engineer at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com).

From 2015 - 2019, I was one of the organisers of the [ClojureBridge](http://clojurebridge-berlin.org) chapter in Berlin. We give free coding workshops for women and non-binary people.
