# Games

I like making tiny games. You can play some of them online:

## Sleepy dog

A game made for the BerlinMiniJam in January 2017. It's written in Clojurescript with Quil. The theme was _Cats, Dogs and Nighttime_, so I made a game about a sleepy, hungry dog. You can play it [here](https://franka.tech/games/sleepy-dog).

## The mermaid situation

A point-and-click that a friend and I made for LudumDare 2016 with ClojureScript and Quil. You're a mermaid stuck in a room who wants to get back to the sea. Try it [here](https://lislis.de/games/mermaid-situation)
